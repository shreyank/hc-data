In May 2025, Heavy Cardboard polled its patrons, asking them to rank their top 50 games. We got 140 responses. The overall rankings were revealed and discussed in a [youtube episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmNY9n6e8DM&t=199s).  We put the data from the poll into this github repository, so other folks could take a look if they wished.

Martin Fowler did some plots of this data, sharing the following files

- [Overall scores and distributions of votes](hc-2025.html)
- [Overall distribution if 18xx was a single game](hc-2025-18xx.html)
- [Compare the ranking of HCHQ to the wider herd](hc-2025-hchq.html)

The R source files for these webpages are in the repository.
